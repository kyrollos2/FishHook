- <ins>FIGMA</ins>: we used figma to make the front end of the FISHBOOK app

- <ins>ProstgreSQL</ins>: Using object-oriented features of PostgreSQL, programmers can communicate with the database servers using objects in their code. Define complex, custom data types.

- <ins>Google Maps API</ins>: The Geocoding API is a service that accepts a place as an address, latitude and longitude coordinates, or place ID. It converts the address into latitude and longitude coordinates and a Place ID, or converts latitude and longitude coordinates or a Place ID into an address.

- <ins>AWS EC2</ins>: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is part of Amazon Web Services (AWS)

- <ins>AWS Lambda</ins>: It was used for hybrid scaling

# Data

- <ins>import psycopg2</ins>: Import using an import psycopg2 statement so you can communicate with the PostgreSQL database.

- <ins>import psycopg2</ins>: psycopg2 is a Python driver for PostgreSQL. It's the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for Python

- <ins>import string</ins>: The Python string module provides several constants that are useful for checking to see if a character, slice, or string contains letters, digits, symbols, etc. To use these constants, we need to import the module into our code.

- <ins>import geopandas as gpd</ins>: GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in Python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.

- <ins>import csv</ins>: The Import-Csv cmdlet creates table-like custom objects from the items in CSV files.
